#### Reflex Advanced Configuration #####################################
#
#   Welcome here! Looks like you want to change something, am
# I right? Before doing so, please note one thing: all the
# settings were tested a lot to work properly. If Reflex breaks
# after you touched anything, it's YOUR fault.
#
#   For any configuration assistance please private message
# DarksideCode on Spigot, open an issue at go.reflex.rip/bug
# or write us in Discord: g.reflex.rip/discord
#
#   PLEASE REFRAIN FROM TOUCHING ANYTHING WITHOUT SERIOUS REASONS TO!
#
#   Also keep in mind that this is ADVANCED configuration.
# One tweak can break everything. Literally. Even your arm.

# Advanced KillAura options
ka:

  # Advanced options for component ka.cbd
  cbd:

    # How many violations* does a player need to score within
    # {period} ticks in order to be flagged? This check is used to detect
    # blatant cheaters that are suspected very often but not heavily.
    #
    # * [Each check gives 'individual' (usually dynamic) number of
    #    violations, which also often differs from the one shown in
    #    verbose, because VLs going to ka.cbd and VLs going to player
    #    are different. The basic rule is same, though: the more the
    #    check is trusted, the more violation points it gives.]
    threshold: 35

    # Checking period in ticks*.
    # (!) NO '/REFLEX RELOAD' SUPPORT: requires full server restart to update!
    #
    # * [1 second = 20 ticks, 2.5 s = 50 ticks, etc.]
    period: 600

  # Advanced options for component ka.clk
  clk:

    # Maximal allowed number of clicks players are allowed to
    # do in one second (20 ticks). Legit jitter is usually ≤ 16
    max_cps: 18

    # Minimal allowed clicking variance. Used to detect constant click rates.
    # Higher - more strict. Lower - more lenient. 0 - disable the check
    min_click_variance: 2

  # Advanced options for component ka.fe
  fe:

    # How many violations will the FrontEntity check add at once?
    # The check itself is very well-known and has been stable for
    # years, however, it might produce a few false positives in
    # rare cases. It is not adviced to set the weight of this check
    # to anything lower than 4-5 because that will make it barely
    # effective. Setting this to something very high is also bad
    weight: 7

  # Advanced options for component ka.heu
  #
  # (i) Settings regarding the Heuristics check do not affect the
  #     core (the NN and datasets) itself, but its "extra" checks
  #     added in release "10.9". Those parts are combined to compute
  #     a CP (Cheat Points) number based on neural network output.
  #     The number of cheat points is always shown in ka.heu verbose
  #     messages like "cp: N". CP is always a natural number, N∈[0..20].
  #     The Heuristics check takes its final decision based both on
  #     NN output and on the number of cheat points, among with some
  #     other factors like lag status and recent behavior of a player.
  heu:

    # If CP number of a player is greater than this (and the core decision
    # is "cheater"), then, no matter the other factors, the player is considered
    # cheating. This means that that player triggered too many "extra" checks
    # at a time and, at the same moment, has been classified as a cheater
    extreme_cp_threshold: 6

    # If the core decision for a player is "cheater", they are not lagging
    # (have a stable/"good" lag status) and have got a number of CP greater
    # then this, then the final decision is going to be "cheater".
    # Does not trigger on players whose lag status is considered "bad"
    stable_cp_threshold: 3

    # If the core decision for a player is "cheater" and moreover the NN
    # is very sure about it (extremely high confidence), and the player's
    # number of CP is greater then then the one set in this option, then
    # the player is considered cheating. High confidence is pretty difficult
    # for a legit player to achieve. When the NN is really "certain" the
    # player is cheating, then most often they really do
    certain_cp_threshold: 2

  # Advanced options for component ka.hbx
  #     This check works by finding the best (not mandatory the most recent)
  #     hitbox of a player's target and then trying to reach it by "moving"
  #     {precision} blocks forward until the total "movement" distance exceeds
  #     a preliminarily calculated limit+{leniency}. If no target hitboxes
  #     (especially no previously mentioned "best" one) were met during
  #     this check, the player is suspected. If a player gets suspected by
  #     the Hitbox check more than {threshold} times in {suspicion_lifespan}
  #     milliseconds, then they are flagged and given KillAura violations
  hbx:

    # The size of one "hitbox tracer" "step" in blocks.
    # Higher precision => higher checking accuracy, but more performance impact;
    # less precision => lower checking accuracy, but less performance impact
    precision: 0.005

    # The number of additional blocks "hitbox tracer" is allowed to "travel"
    # after exceeding the preliminarily calculated limit before stopping.
    # Higher leniency => less effective (way more lenient) check
    leniency: 0.013

    # The maximal number of suspicions a player is allowed to obtain in
    # {suspicion_lifespan} seconds before being flagged for cheating
    threshold: 7

    # After how many milliseconds* will Hitbox's suspicions be forgotten?
    # * [1 second = 1000 milliseconds, 2.5 s = 2500 ms, etc.]
    suspicion_lifespan: 3000

    # How many violations will the Hitbox check add at once (after
    # a player will score more than {threshold} suspicions in {...lifespan}
    # milliseconds)? This check is designed to kick quickly but not instantly
    weight: 20

  # Advanced options for component ka.yrt
  yrt:

    # How probable (in percent, %) does a player need to be cheating
    # according to the ka.yrt check in order to be flagged for KillAura
    max_probability: 70

# Advanced InvActions options
invact:

  # Advanced options for component invact.mov
  mov:

    # For how many milliseconds* are players allowed to move and/or
    # rotate with open inventory? Reducing this number will speed
    # detection of InventoryWalk hacks up, but may increase the number
    # of false positives in various situations.
    #
    # * [1 second = 1000 milliseconds, 2.5 s = 2500 ms, etc.]
    open_wait: 500

# Advanced BlockActions options
#
# (i) One may want to reduce the values here a little bit in case of many
#     "ultra-professional" players on the server who are "known" (trusted)
#     to be able to build very quickly without any mods, autoclickers, etc.
blckact:

  # Advanced options for component blckact.sfd
  sfd:

    # Minimal delay between placing blocks when bridging horizontally (in ticks*).
    # Higher - more strict. Lower - more lenient. 0.0 - disable the check.
    #
    # * [1 second = 20 ticks, 2.5 s = 50 ticks, etc.]
    min_hor: 5.0

    # Minimal delay between placing blocks when bridging diagonally (in ticks*).
    # Higher - more strict. Lower - more lenient. 0.0 - disable the check.

    # * [1 second = 20 ticks, 2.5 s = 50 ticks, etc.]
    min_dia: 5.0
    
  # Advanced options for component blckact.tw
  tw:
    
    # Minimal delay between placing blocks when towering up (in ticks*).
    # Higher - more strict. Lower - more lenient. 0.0 - disable the check.
