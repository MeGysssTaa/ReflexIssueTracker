# Reflex Issue Tracker

1. Developers can easily maintain Reflex related issues.
2. People can see Reflex progress and avoid creating repetitive issues all the time.
3. Maintain a convenient [Reflex Wiki containing everything one may ever want to know about this project.](https://g.reflex.rip/wiki)
4. Store Reflex-related files such as config, terms of use and overview translations.
